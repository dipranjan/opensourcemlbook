<p>Convolutional Neural Networks are very similar to ordinary Neural Networks, they are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image pixels on one end to class scores at the other. And they still have a loss function (e.g. SVM/Softmax) on the last (fully-connected) layer and all the tips/tricks we developed for learning regular Neural Networks still apply.</p>
<p>So what changes? ConvNet architectures make the explicit assumption that the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties into the architecture. These then make the forward function more efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in the network.</p>
<div class="section" id="architecture-overview">
<h2>Architecture Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#architecture-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Neural Networks receive an input (a single vector), and transform it through a series of hidden layers. Each hidden layer is made up of a set of neurons, where each neuron is fully connected to all neurons in the previous layer, and where neurons in a single layer function completely independently and do not share any connections. The last fully-connected layer is called the âoutput layerâ and in classification settings it represents the class scores.</p>
<p>Regular Neural Nets donât scale well to full images. In CIFAR-10, images are only of size <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( 32*32*3 \)</span> (32 wide, 32 high, 3 color channels RGB), so a single fully-connected neuron in a first hidden layer of a regular Neural Network would have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( 32*32*3 = 3072 \)</span> weights. This amount still seems manageable, but clearly this fully-connected structure does not scale to larger images. For example, an image of more respectable size, e.g. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( 200*200*3\)</span>, would lead to neurons that have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(200*200*3 = 120,000\)</span> weights. Moreover, we would almost certainly want to have several such neurons, so the parameters would add up quickly! Clearly, this full connectivity is wasteful and the huge number of parameters would quickly lead to overfitting.</p>
<p>3D volumes of neurons. Convolutional Neural Networks take advantage of the fact that the input consists of images and they constrain the architecture in a more sensible way. In particular, unlike a regular Neural Network, the layers of a ConvNet have neurons arranged in 3 dimensions: width, height, depth. (Note that the word depth here refers to the third dimension of an activation volume, not to the depth of a full Neural Network, which can refer to the total number of layers in a network.) For example, the input images in CIFAR-10 are an input volume of activations, and the volume has dimensions <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(32*32*3\)</span> (width, height, depth respectively). As we will soon see, the neurons in a layer will only be connected to a small region of the layer before it, instead of all of the neurons in a fully-connected manner. Moreover, the final output layer would for CIFAR-10 have dimensions <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1*1*10\)</span>, because by the end of the ConvNet architecture we will reduce the full image into a single vector of class scores, arranged along the depth dimension. Here is a visualization:</p>

Right: A ConvNet arranges its neurons in three dimensions (width, height, depth), as visualized in one of the layers.

<h2>Layers used to build ConvNets<a class="headerlink" href="#layers-used-to-build-convnets" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>As we described above, a simple ConvNet is a sequence of layers, and every layer of a ConvNet transforms one volume of activations to another through a differentiable function. We use three main types of layers to build ConvNet architectures: Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer, and Fully-Connected Layer (exactly as seen in regular Neural Networks). We will stack these layers to form a full ConvNet architecture.</p>
<p>Example Architecture: Overview. We will go into more details below, but a simple ConvNet for CIFAR-10 classification could have the architecture [INPUT - CONV - RELU - POOL - FC]. In more detail:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>INPUT [32x32x3] will hold the raw pixel values of the image, in this case an image of width 32, height 32, and with three color channels R,G,B.</p></li>
<li><p>CONV layer will compute the output of neurons that are connected to local regions in the input, each computing a dot product between their weights and a small region they are connected to in the input volume. This may result in volume such as [32x32x12] if we decided to use 12 filters.</p></li>
<li><p>RELU layer will apply an elementwise activation function, such as the max(0,x) thresholding at zero. This leaves the size of the volume unchanged ([32x32x12]).</p></li>
<li><p>POOL layer will perform a downsampling operation along the spatial dimensions (width, height), resulting in volume such as [16x16x12].</p></li>
<li><p>FC (i.e. fully-connected) layer will compute the class scores, resulting in volume of size [1x1x10], where each of the 10 numbers correspond to a class score, such as among the 10 categories of CIFAR-10. As with ordinary Neural Networks and as the name implies, each neuron in this layer will be connected to all the numbers in the previous volume.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this way, ConvNets transform the original image layer by layer from the original pixel values to the final class scores. Note that some layers contain parameters and other donât. In particular, the CONV/FC layers perform transformations that are a function of not only the activations in the input volume, but also of the parameters (the weights and biases of the neurons). On the other hand, the RELU/POOL layers will implement a fixed function. The parameters in the CONV/FC layers will be trained with gradient descent so that the class scores that the ConvNet computes are consistent with the labels in the training set for each image.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A ConvNet architecture is in the simplest case a list of Layers that transform the image volume into an output volume (e.g. holding the class scores)</p></li>
<li><p>There are a few distinct types of Layers (e.g. CONV/FC/RELU/POOL are by far the most popular)</p></li>
<li><p>Each Layer accepts an input 3D volume and transforms it to an output 3D volume through a differentiable function</p></li>
<li><p>Each Layer may or may not have parameters (e.g. CONV/FC do, RELU/POOL donât)</p></li>
<li><p>Each Layer may or may not have additional hyperparameters (e.g. CONV/FC/POOL do, RELU doesnât)</p></li>

<h3>Convolutional Layer<a class="headerlink" href="#convolutional-layer" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The Conv layer is the core building block of a Convolutional Network that does most of the computational heavy lifting.</p>
<p><strong>Overview and intuition without brain stuff:</strong> Letâs first discuss what the CONV layer computes without brain/neuron analogies. The CONV layerâs parameters consist of a set of learnable filters. Every filter is small spatially (along width and height), but extends through the full depth of the input volume. For example, a typical filter on a first layer of a ConvNet might have size <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5x5x3\)</span> (i.e. 5 pixels width and height, and 3 because images have depth 3, the color channels). During the forward pass, we slide (more precisely, convolve) each filter across the width and height of the input volume and compute dot products between the entries of the filter and the input at any position. As we slide the filter over the width and height of the input volume we will produce a 2-dimensional activation map that gives the responses of that filter at every spatial position. Intuitively, the network will learn filters that activate when they see some type of visual feature such as an edge of some orientation or a blotch of some color on the first layer, or eventually entire honeycomb or wheel-like patterns on higher layers of the network. Now, we will have an entire set of filters in each CONV layer (e.g. 12 filters), and each of them will produce a separate 2-dimensional activation map. We will stack these activation maps along the depth dimension and produce the output volume.</p>
<p><strong>The brain view:</strong> If youâre a fan of the brain/neuron analogies, every entry in the 3D output volume can also be interpreted as an output of a neuron that looks at only a small region in the input and shares parameters with all neurons to the left and right spatially (since these numbers all result from applying the same filter). We now discuss the details of the neuron connectivities, their arrangement in space, and their parameter sharing scheme.</p>
<p><strong>Local Connectivity:</strong> When dealing with high-dimensional inputs such as images, as we saw above it is impractical to connect neurons to all neurons in the previous volume. Instead, we will connect each neuron to only a local region of the input volume. The spatial extent of this connectivity is a hyperparameter called the receptive field of the neuron (equivalently this is the filter size). The extent of the connectivity along the depth axis is always equal to the depth of the input volume. It is important to emphasize again this asymmetry in how we treat the spatial dimensions (width and height) and the depth dimension: The connections are local in space (along width and height), but always full along the entire depth of the input volume.</p>
<p><em>Example 1.</em> For example, suppose that the input volume has size <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([32*32*3]\)</span>, (e.g. an RGB CIFAR-10 image). If the receptive field (or the filter size) is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5*5\)</span>, then each neuron in the Conv Layer will have weights to a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([5*5*3]\)</span> region in the input volume, for a total of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5*5*3 = 75\)</span> weights (and +1 bias parameter). Notice that the extent of the connectivity along the depth axis must be 3, since this is the depth of the input volume.</p>
<p><em>Example 2.</em> Suppose an input volume had size <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([16*16*20]\)</span>. Then using an example receptive field size of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3*3\)</span>, every neuron in the Conv Layer would now have a total of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3*3*20 = 180\)</span> connections to the input volume. Notice that, again, the connectivity is local in space (e.g. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3x3\)</span>), but full along the input depth (20).</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="image3">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../../_images/image3.png"><img alt="../../../_images/image3.png" src="../../../_images/image3.png" style="height: 150px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 3 </span><span class="caption-text">Left: An example input volume in red (e.g. a 32x32x3 CIFAR-10 image), and an example volume of neurons in the first Convolutional layer. Each neuron in the convolutional layer is connected only to a local region in the input volume spatially, but to the full depth (i.e. all color channels). Note, there are multiple neurons (5 in this example) along the depth, all looking at the same region in the input - see discussion of depth columns in text below. Right: The neurons from the Neural Network chapter remain unchanged: They still compute a dot product of their weights with the input followed by a non-linearity, but their connectivity is now restricted to be local spatially.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#image3" title="Permalink to this image">Â¶</a></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Spatial arrangement:</strong> We have explained the connectivity of each neuron in the Conv Layer to the input volume, but we havenât yet discussed how many neurons there are in the output volume or how they are arranged. Three hyperparameters control the size of the output volume: the depth, stride and zero-padding. We discuss these next:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>First, the depth of the output volume is a hyperparameter: it corresponds to the number of filters we would like to use, each learning to look for something different in the input. For example, if the first Convolutional Layer takes as input the raw image, then different neurons along the depth dimension may activate in presence of various oriented edges, or blobs of color. We will refer to a set of neurons that are all looking at the same region of the input as a depth column (some people also prefer the term fibre).</p></li>
<li><p>Second, we must specify the stride with which we slide the filter. When the stride is 1 then we move the filters one pixel at a time. When the stride is 2 (or uncommonly 3 or more, though this is rare in practice) then the filters jump 2 pixels at a time as we slide them around. This will produce smaller output volumes spatially.
As we will soon see, sometimes it will be convenient to pad the input volume with zeros around the border. The size of this zero-padding is a hyperparameter. The nice feature of zero padding is that it will allow us to control the spatial size of the output volumes (most commonly as weâll see soon we will use it to exactly preserve the spatial size of the input volume so the input and output width and height are the same).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can compute the spatial size of the output volume as a function of the input volume size (W
), the receptive field size of the Conv Layer neurons (F), the stride with which they are applied (S), and the amount of zero padding used (P) on the border. You can convince yourself that the correct formula for calculating how many neurons âfitâ is given by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((WâF+2P)/S+1\)</span>. For example for a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(7x7\)</span> input and a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3x3\)</span> filter with stride 1 and pad 0 we would get a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5x5\)</span> output. With stride 2 we would get a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3x3\)</span> output. Lets also see one more graphical example:</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 4 </span><span class="caption-text">Illustration of spatial arrangement. In this example there is only one spatial dimension (x-axis), one neuron with a receptive field size of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F = 3\)</span>, the input size is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W = 5\)</span>, and there is zero padding of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P = 1\)</span>. Left: The neuron strided across the input in stride of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S = 1\)</span>, giving output of size <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((5 - 3 + 2)/1+1 = 5\)</span>. Right: The neuron uses stride of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S = 2\)</span>, giving output of size <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((5 - 3 + 2)/2+1 = 3\)</span>. Notice that stride <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S = 3\)</span> could not be used since it wouldnât fit neatly across the volume. In terms of the equation, this can be determined since <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((5 - 3 + 2) = 4\)</span> is not divisible by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3\)</span>.
The neuron weights are in this example <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([1,0,-1]\)</span> (shown on very right), and its bias is zero. These weights are shared across all yellow neurons (see parameter sharing below).</span><a class="headerlink" href="#image4" title="Permalink to this image">Â¶</a></p>

<p><strong>Use of zero-padding:</strong> In the example above on left, note that the input dimension was 5 and the output dimension was equal: also 5. This worked out so because our receptive fields were 3 and we used zero padding of 1. If there was no zero-padding used, then the output volume would have had spatial dimension of only 3, because that is how many neurons would have âfitâ across the original input. In general, setting zero padding to be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P=(Fâ1)/2\)</span> when the stride is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S=1\)</span> ensures that the input volume and output volume will have the same size spatially. It is very common to use zero-padding in this way and we will discuss the full reasons when we talk more about ConvNet architectures.</p>
<p>Constraints on strides. Note again that the spatial arrangement hyperparameters have mutual constraints. For example, when the input has size <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W=10\)</span>, no zero-padding is used <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P=0\)</span>, and the filter size is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F=3\)</span>, then it would be impossible to use stride <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S=2\)</span>, since <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((WâF+2P)/S+1=(10â3+0)/2+1=4.5\)</span>, i.e. not an integer, indicating that the neurons donât âfitâ neatly and symmetrically across the input. Therefore, this setting of the hyperparameters is considered to be invalid, and a ConvNet library could throw an exception or zero pad the rest to make it fit, or crop the input to make it fit, or something. As we will see in the ConvNet architectures section, sizing the ConvNets appropriately so that all the dimensions âwork outâ can be a real headache, which the use of zero-padding and some design guidelines will significantly alleviate.</p>
<p>Real-world example. The Krizhevsky et al. architecture that won the ImageNet challenge in 2012 accepted images of size <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([227x227x3]\)</span>. On the first Convolutional Layer, it used neurons with receptive field size <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F=11\)</span>, stride <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S=4\)</span> and no zero padding <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P=0\)</span>. Since <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((227 - 11)/4 + 1 = 55\)</span>, and since the Conv layer had a depth of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K=96\)</span>, the Conv layer output volume had size <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([55x55x96]\)</span>. Each of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(55*55*96\)</span> neurons in this volume was connected to a region of size <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([11x11x3]\)</span> in the input volume. Moreover, all 96 neurons in each depth column are connected to the same <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([11x11x3]\)</span> region of the input, but of course with different weights. As a fun aside, if you read the actual paper it claims that the input images were <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(224x224\)</span>, which is surely incorrect because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((224 - 11)/4 + 1\)</span> is quite clearly not an integer. This has confused many people in the history of ConvNets and little is known about what happened. My own best guess is that Alex used zero-padding of 3 extra pixels that he does not mention in the paper.</p>
