# About this Book


This book is a collection of some good open source Machine learning resources out there. The book does not belong to me, it belongs to the entire community, I have just taken it upon me to collect the fantastic resources in a book format as a comprehensive source for someone starting out.

To the best of my knowledge I have ensured that the resources used here are available under free-to-use license. Incase you feel that is not the case, please open an issue stating the same and I will take a look into it.

Every book contains within it the author's style, which makes reading the book a seamless experience or brings some sort of uniformity to the book. However given the nature of this book it will not be the case, this book will be a mish-mash of different styles depending on the original source.

If you come across any Open Source Resource that you think should be here or even if you have a way to explain things better, please feel free to create a pull request.
